# Advanced options

puffgres is configured in two places:

- **`puffgres.toml`** — this is a commmited file that defines runtime behavior (batch sizes, retries, timeouts) and which `.env` files to load.
- **Environment variables** — secrets and connection details (database URL, turbopuffer key), loaded from the config above. 

## `puffgres.toml`

This lives at the root of your puffgres project and is created with `puffgres init`. Every field except `environment_files` is optional and has a sensible default. It will look something like this

```toml
environment_files = ["./.env", "../.env", "../.env.development"]
batch_size = 100
max_retries = 5

# Dead letter queue 
dlq_replay_interval = 10
dlq_replay_batch_size = 50
dlq_max_retries = 5
dlq_permanent_max_age_hours = 72

# Advanced (uncomment to override defaults)
# max_transaction_events = 1000000
# sub_batch_size = 1000
# transform_timeout_secs = 30
# config_concurrency = 4
# maintenance_interval_secs = 600
# tls_unclean_close_level = "error"
```

### `environment_files`

**Required.** List of `.env` file paths to load, relative to the `puffgres.toml` location. Earlier files take priority over later ones. Shell environment variables take highest precedence over all files.

### `batch_size`

Number of replication events to collect before flushing a batch to turbopuffer. Default: **100**. This is a deliberately low cap so that it doesn't break for users setting this up as a test with low-rate-limit embedding providers. See [the programming model](./programming-model.md#batching-and-retries) for how batching works.

### `max_retries`

Number of times to retry a failed batch before sending it to the dead letter queue. Default: **5**.

### Dead letter queue

When a batch fails after `max_retries`, it goes to the dead letter queue (DLQ) so the stream isn't blocked. These knobs control how the DLQ is drained and pruned. You probably don't need to change these and can use the defaults. See [the programming model](./programming-model.md#dead-letter-queue) for how the DLQ works.

#### `dlq_replay_interval`

How often (in seconds) to replay retryable entries from the dead letter queue. Default: **10**.

#### `dlq_replay_batch_size`

Maximum number of dead letter queue entries to replay per interval. Default: **50**.

#### `dlq_max_retries`

Number of times to retry a dead letter queue entry before marking it as permanently failed / unretryable. Default: **5**.

#### `dlq_permanent_max_age_hours`

How long (in hours) to keep permanently-failed dead letter queue entries before discarding them. Default: **72**.

### Large transactions

#### `max_transaction_events`

Maximum number of events allowed in a single Postgres transaction. This is a way to deal with transactions that might exaust the memory of the puffgres process all at once. Transactions exceeding this limit are skipped and logged. Has no effect when `sub_batch_size` is set, and we break them up. Default: **1,000,000**.

#### `sub_batch_size`

When set, large transactions are streamed in sub-batches of this size instead of buffering the entire transaction in memory. The pipeline processes chunks as they arrive, giving natural backpressure. We don't commit until all of them. Unset by default (entire transaction is buffered). Obviously this interrupts some of our consistency goals, so use with caution. 

### `transform_timeout_secs`

How long puffgres waits for a single `transform.ts` batch response before killing and respawning the worker process. Default: **30** seconds.

### `config_concurrency`

Max number of configs to transform and send concurrently within one CDC batch. Each config still uses one transform subprocess and writes its own turbopuffer namespace in order, so fan-out (e.g. page to page_chunks) and id remapping keep working. Default: **1** (serial across configs). Raise this when many configs share a batch; it does not parallelize a single hot table.

### `maintenance_interval_secs`

How often (in seconds) puffgres runs background maintenance — currently pruning stale permanent DLQ entries past `dlq_permanent_max_age_hours`. Default: **600**.

### `tls_unclean_close_level`

Logging level for unclean TLS shutdowns (missing `close_notify`). Supported values: `error`, `warn`, `silent`. Default: **error**. This was throwing a bunch of unecessary errors for us in Sentry, that weren't severe, so we swapped to `warn`.

## Environment variables

### `DATABASE_URL`

Non-pooled URL for your Postgres database. Pooled connections cannot handle logical replication!

```sh
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/db"
```

### `TURBOPUFFER_API_KEY`

```sh
TURBOPUFFER_API_KEY="tpuf_abc123..."
```

### `TURBOPUFFER_NAMESPACE_PREFIX`

Prefix for all turbopuffer namespaces. If set to `PUFFGRES_PRODUCTION` and you create a namespace called `page`, it saves as `PUFFGRES_PRODUCTION_page`.

```sh
TURBOPUFFER_NAMESPACE_PREFIX="PUFFGRES_PRODUCTION"
```

### `PUFFGRES_STATE_SCHEMA`

Postgres schema (in the same database as `DATABASE_URL`) where puffgres keeps its own state — applied configs, replication checkpoints, backfill cursors, and the DLQ. Defaults to `puffgres`. The schema is created on first run; the `DATABASE_URL` role needs `CREATE SCHEMA` and DML privileges on it (or you can pre-create the schema and grant DML only).

```sh
PUFFGRES_STATE_SCHEMA="puffgres"
```

Because state lives in the source database, point in time restores will roll the backfill cursors back and should work. 

### `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`

OpenTelemetry endpoint, if you want observability. We use Sentry for this and it works well. 

```sh
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="https://a123.ingest.us.sentry.io/api/1234/integration/otlp"
```

### `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS`

Headers for the OTLP exporter.

```sh
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="x-sentry-auth=sentry sentry_key=a123"
```

#### Sentry alerting

If you export OTLP to Sentry, keep connection-failure events at warning level in puffgres and set the alert threshold in Sentry. A practical starting point is an issue alert for `connection failed, reconnecting` when it happens more than once in one hour.

### Other environment variables

You may also want to set environment variables you use in transformations, i.e. `ZEROENTROPY_API_KEY` or `BASETEN_API_KEY` for embeddings.
